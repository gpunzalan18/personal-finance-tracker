      ><strong>Personal Finance Tracker (PFT)</strong> is a simple tool to
      understand your income and expenses and provide you with a wholistic
      picture of your finances.
    </span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Please note that PFT will not store any of the information you provide.
      The downside is that every time you visit, you'd have to provide your data
      again. Alternatively, if you simply want to explore, PFT will give you an
      option to use a demo data along the way.
